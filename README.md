# Responsive-Flex-Floating-Labels

### Summary
  
 To gain a better understanding of responsive design and floating labels pattern in forms, 
 I decided the best way to learn is to put them in practice.  This is a simple webpage built 
 first and foremost with mobile first, and having a breakpoint at 768px to render pages for 
 desktops and tablets.  The floating labels act as signal for the user if they completed the 
 fields correctly.  Originally, the idea was to use it as a placeholder attribute.  
 After a few iterations, I settled for field indicator for the user.
